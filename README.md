# Coxcomb Graph Explorations

This is an experiment to play with coxcomb graphs like the Nightingale Rose graph used as an example in several past online projects.

This repo is a clone of https://gist.github.com/kgryte/5932401.

Plans include varying the data, studying the graph and D3 implementation, all for learning purposes. If you find this and want to applaud anything here, credit belongs to https://github.com/kgryte.
